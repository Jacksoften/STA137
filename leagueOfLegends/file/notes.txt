model selection of polynomial regression

(solved by using auto.arima() in forecast package)
(alternative solution: using arima() function and manully input AR and MA orders)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem:
The PACF graph shows that we have MA(1) process.
Combining ACF and PACF plots, we have model ARMA(1,1)
But the auto.arima() function returns us that the ARMA(1,0) model
has hte smallest aic.
